# MWLT-Transformer-based-Missing-Well-Log-Prediction
This is a repository for the paper "MWLT: Transformer-based Missing Well Log Prediction" (submit to JPSE)).
## Example
This is an example of a density profile prediction for a well in the Lianggaoshan workings, Sichuan Basin.

## Project Organization
The repository contains is organized logically according to the following figure, the results contain hyperparameter settings, training loss, evaluation metrics, well-trained model, and prediction results.
Test_blind contains two workspace test well examples, and you can use jupyter notebook to follow predict.ipynb to reproduce our results.
